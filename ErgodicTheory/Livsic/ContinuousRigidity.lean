# Livšic rigidity for continuous transfer functions

This file is the **continuous-solution tier** of the measurable-Livšic rigidity programme
(issue #29). Building on the shared vocabulary of `ErgodicTheory.Livsic.Defs`
(`IsCoboundary`, `HasVanishingPeriodicSums`, the telescoping identity
`birkhoffSum_eq_of_coboundary` and the trivial direction
`IsCoboundary.hasVanishingPeriodicSums`), it proves the *easy but genuinely useful* half of the
measurable rigidity statement outright:

> If a **continuous** transfer function `u` solves the cohomological equation `φ = u ∘ T − u`
> only `μ`-almost-everywhere, for a **fully supported** measure `μ` (`μ.IsOpenPosMeasure`) and a
> continuous `φ`, then `φ` has **vanishing periodic sums**: `birkhoffSum T φ n p = 0` for every
> `n`-periodic point `p`.

## The three-tier structure of measurable Livšic rigidity

The Livšic regularity programme splits by the regularity one assumes of the a.e. transfer function
`u` solving `φ = u ∘ T − u`:

1. **Continuous tier (this file).** If `u` is already *continuous* and `μ` is fully supported, then
   the a.e. equation upgrades to an *everywhere* equation (`Continuous.ae_eq_iff_eq`), so `φ` is a
   genuine coboundary and `IsCoboundary.hasVanishingPeriodicSums` finishes. Needs **no** ergodicity,
   hyperbolicity, or Lusin/recurrence machinery.
2. **Bounded-measurable tier** (`ErgodicTheory.Livsic.BoundedRigidity`). `u` merely measurable but
   **bounded**; the everywhere upgrade is unavailable, and one instead runs a periodic-orbit
   shadowing argument on cylinders of the full shift, using that the endpoint difference
   `u (T^[N] x) − u x` is controlled *uniformly in `N`* precisely because `u` is bounded.
3. **Unbounded-measurable tier — deliberately deferred.** For a genuinely unbounded measurable `u`
   the uniform endpoint control breaks, and the theorem is the classical Livšic *regularity* theorem
   (Katok–Hasselblatt, Theorem 19.2.4), whose proof needs a Lusin-continuity/regularity argument.
   This is left as a follow-up issue.

The substantive content of the harder tiers is precisely the *promotion of a merely measurable `u`
to a controllable one*; once that promotion is available, the present lemma finishes.

## Main definitions

* `ErgodicTheory.IsAeCoboundaryOf μ T φ u` — witnessed a.e. coboundary of the given `u` (generic,
  parallel to `IsCoboundary`).
* `ErgodicTheory.IsAeCoboundary μ T φ` — `φ` is an a.e. coboundary of a *measurable* `u`.

(The obstruction class `HasVanishingPeriodicSums` and the coboundary vocabulary `IsCoboundary`
live in `ErgodicTheory.Livsic.Defs` and are reused here unchanged.)

## Main results

* `ErgodicTheory.Livsic.hasVanishingPeriodicSums_of_continuous_coboundary` — the continuous-tier
  Livšic rigidity theorem.

/-- **Continuous-tier Livšic rigidity.** If `φ` is continuous and equals the coboundary of a
**continuous** `u` only `μ`-a.e., then — because `μ` is fully supported, so a.e.-equal continuous
functions are equal — `φ` is an *everywhere* coboundary, hence (via the trivial telescoping
direction `IsCoboundary.hasVanishingPeriodicSums`) has vanishing periodic sums.

This is the rigidity theorem in the regularity class in which it is elementary. The substantive
content of measurable Livšic is precisely the *promotion of a merely measurable `u` to a continuous
one*; once that promotion is available, this lemma finishes. -/

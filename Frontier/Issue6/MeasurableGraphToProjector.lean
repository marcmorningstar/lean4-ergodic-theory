# From a measurable subspace frame to a measurable orthogonal projector

For a measurably-varying family of subspaces `V : X → Submodule ℝ (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin d))`
the multiplicative ergodic theorem (in its measurable / non-invertible form) needs the
**orthogonal-projection matrix** `x ↦ orthProjMatrix (V x)` to be measurable. This file
delivers the *finite-dimensional constant-rank* route to that fact: starting from a
measurable family of vectors that is, for each `x`, an **orthonormal basis** of `V x`, the
projector is the (manifestly measurable) Gram matrix of the frame.

This is the converter on which the unconditional singular Oseledets filtration ("issue #6")
turns: the measurable graph of the eventual-kernel family
(`ErgodicTheory.measurableSet_graph_eventualKer`) plus constant kernel dimension yields, by a
finite measurable stratification + Gram–Schmidt, exactly such a measurable orthonormal frame.
The clean, fully `sorry`-free heart of the converter — *measurable orthonormal frame ⇒
measurable projector* — is `measurable_orthProjMatrix_of_orthonormalFrame`, and (granted the
KRN/Castaing **conclusion**, `HasMeasurableSpanningFrame V`) the everywhere-Borel projector is
`sorry`-free via `measurable_orthProjMatrix_of_frame`. The remaining, genuinely measure-theoretic,
step is *not* the measurable selection — that Castaing selection is `sorry`-free downstream in
`Frontier.Issue6.CastaingSelection` (polarisation shortcut) — but the KRN **hypothesis** (weak
measurability of `x ↦ V x`) in *graph* form: the projection of the Borel graph onto `X` through a
ball. Its `x`-sections are σ-compact, so by the **Arsenin–Kunugui** theorem the projection is
Borel — a *true* statement Mathlib cannot yet prove (it has only the Lusin–Souslin analytic-set
machinery, under which a projection is merely analytic). It is isolated in
`exists_measurable_independentSpanningFrame_of_measurableGraph` and flagged there. The
a.e./universally-measurable weakening of that node *is* available and `sorry`-free
(`Frontier.Issue6.MeasurableProjection`, migrated to `ErgodicTheory.Singular.MeasurableProjection`).

## Main definitions

* `ErgodicTheory.IsMeasurableOrthonormalFrame`: a family `e : X → Fin m → EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin d)`
  is a measurable orthonormal frame for `V` when each component map is measurable and, for
  every `x`, `e x` is orthonormal and spans `V x`.

## Main results

* `ErgodicTheory.starProjection_eq_sum_inner_smul_of_span`: for an orthonormal family `e` whose
  span is `K`, the orthogonal projection onto `K` is `v ↦ ∑ i, ⟪e i, v⟫ • e i`.
* `ErgodicTheory.orthProjMatrix_entry_eq_sum`: the `(a, b)` entry of `orthProjMatrix K` equals
  `∑ i, e i a * e i b` for such a frame — the Gram (outer-product sum) formula.
* `ErgodicTheory.measurable_orthProjMatrix_of_orthonormalFrame`: **the converter's core** —
  a measurable orthonormal frame for `V` makes `x ↦ orthProjMatrix (V x)` measurable
  (hence `MeasurableSubspace V`).
* `ErgodicTheory.measurable_gramSchmidt`, `ErgodicTheory.measurable_gramSchmidtNormed`: Gram–Schmidt
  is measurable in its input frame (`sorry`-free).
* `ErgodicTheory.isMeasurableOrthonormalFrame_gramSchmidtNormed`: a measurable, pointwise
  independent, pointwise spanning frame orthonormalises to a measurable orthonormal frame
  (`sorry`-free) — this discharges the orthonormalisation half of the converter.
* `ErgodicTheory.HasMeasurableSpanningFrame`: the KRN/Castaing **conclusion** as a hypothesis — `V`
  admits a measurable, pointwise independent, pointwise spanning frame.
* `ErgodicTheory.measurable_orthProjMatrix_of_frame`, `ErgodicTheory.measurableSubspace_of_frame`:
  **the conditional everywhere-Borel projector, `sorry`-free** — granted
  `HasMeasurableSpanningFrame`, `x ↦ orthProjMatrix (V x)` is measurable. The converter has *no*
  measure-theoretic gap beyond this hypothesis.
* `ErgodicTheory.measurableSubspace_of_measurableGraph_constDim`: **the target** — a measurable
  graph together with constant finite rank gives a measurable projector. It is reduced to the
  core via the frame-existence lemma below.

## The isolated measure-theoretic gap

* `ErgodicTheory.exists_measurable_independentSpanningFrame_of_measurableGraph` (`sorry`, BLOCKED):
  production of the measurable spanning frame from a *bare* measurable graph at constant rank. The
  measurable-selection (KRN/Castaing) content is **not** the obstruction — it is `sorry`-free
  downstream in `Frontier.Issue6.CastaingSelection`
  (`Frontier.exists_measurable_independentSpanningFrame_of_measurableInfDist`, a polarisation
  shortcut), and orthonormalisation is `sorry`-free above. The obstruction is the KRN *hypothesis*
  itself in graph form: *weak measurability* of `x ↦ V x`, i.e. measurability of the projection
  `{x | infDist c (V x) < r} = Prod.fst '' (graph ∩ (univ ×ˢ ball c r))`. Its `x`-sections are
  σ-compact, so the **Arsenin–Kunugui** theorem makes the projection Borel — *true*, but Mathlib has
  only Lusin–Souslin (projection ⟹ analytic, generally non-Borel by Suslin) and no
  `MeasurableSpace`/`Borel` structure on the Grassmannian, so the everywhere-Borel discharge has no
  Mathlib foothold. The node is *equivalent to the converter's target itself* (via
  `infDist c (V x) = ‖c − (V x).starProjection c‖`), confirming it is irreducible. The a.e.
  weakening (analytic ⟹ universally measurable) *is* `sorry`-free and already migrated
  (`ErgodicTheory.Singular.MeasurableProjection`).

/-! ### The KRN/Castaing *conclusion*, conditioned: an everywhere-Borel projector

The Kuratowski–Ryll-Nardzewski / Castaing measurable-selection theorem is an *implication*
`weak measurability ⟹ a measurable selection (Castaing representation)`. The two halves of that
implication play very different roles in this converter, and it is worth isolating them precisely.

* The **conclusion** of KRN — that a measurable, pointwise linearly-independent, pointwise
  spanning frame `f` for `V` *exists* — is captured by the predicate `HasMeasurableSpanningFrame V`
  below. **Granted this conclusion, the everywhere-Borel projector is `sorry`-free**: Gram–Schmidt
  orthonormalises `f` measurably (`isMeasurableOrthonormalFrame_gramSchmidtNormed`) and the Gram
  outer-product formula turns the frame into the measurable projector
  (`measurable_orthProjMatrix_of_orthonormalFrame`). This is `measurable_orthProjMatrix_of_frame`.

* The **hypothesis** of KRN — weak measurability of the multifunction `x ↦ V x`, i.e. measurability
  of `{x | V x ∩ U ≠ ∅}` for every open `U` — is the *only* thing the bare measurable graph does not
  hand us for free. Producing the frame from a measurable graph is therefore neither the
  Gram–Schmidt step nor the selection step (both elementary / already done): it is exactly the
  *weak-measurability* step `graph ⟹ {x | V x ∩ U ≠ ∅} measurable`, which for the subspace-valued,
  constant-rank multifunction is the **Arsenin–Kunugui** projection theorem (see the BLOCKED leaf
  below).

So the converter's only genuine wall is the KRN *hypothesis* in its graph form, not the KRN
selection itself; the selection content is delivered `sorry`-free downstream in
`Frontier.Issue6.CastaingSelection` (via a finite-dimensional polarisation shortcut), and the
present section records the `sorry`-free conditional half here, at the converter's own layer. -/

/-- **The KRN/Castaing conclusion, as a hypothesis.** `V` *has a measurable spanning frame* at
rank `m` when there is a measurable family `f : X → Fin m → EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin d)` that is, at
every `x`, linearly independent and spans `V x`. This is exactly the deliverable of the
Kuratowski–Ryll-Nardzewski / Castaing measurable-selection theorem for the closed-valued (here
finite-dimensional-subspace-valued) multifunction `x ↦ V x`. Everything the converter needs is a
`sorry`-free consequence of this predicate (`measurable_orthProjMatrix_of_frame`,
`measurableSubspace_of_frame`); only its *production* from a bare measurable graph is the
Arsenin–Kunugui wall. -/

(`isMeasurableOrthonormalFrame_gramSchmidtNormed`) and fed to the `sorry`-free Gram-formula core
(`measurable_orthProjMatrix_of_orthonormalFrame`). This is the *positive* half of KRN/Castaing for

/-! ### The measure-theoretic gap: from a measurable graph to a measurable frame

By the previous section the converter is `sorry`-free *given* a measurable spanning frame
(`HasMeasurableSpanningFrame`, the KRN/Castaing conclusion). The remaining BLOCKED leaf is purely
the production of that frame from a *bare measurable graph* — i.e. the KRN *hypothesis* (weak
measurability) in graph form, which is the Arsenin–Kunugui projection theorem. -/

/-- **Existence of a measurable orthonormal frame from a measurable graph at constant rank.**
A measurable graph `{(x, v) | v ∈ V x}` together with constant finite dimension `m` yields a
measurable orthonormal frame `e` for `V`.

**This is the single genuinely measure-theoretic gap of the converter and is left `sorry`
(BLOCKED).** It is the production of a `HasMeasurableSpanningFrame V` (the KRN/Castaing conclusion)
from the bare measurable graph; granted that frame, the everywhere-Borel projector is `sorry`-free
(`measurable_orthProjMatrix_of_frame`). Two contributing steps are *already done* `sorry`-free, so
the remaining gap is sharper than "Castaing representation absent":

* **The KRN/Castaing selection itself is NOT the wall.** The finite-dimensional Castaing
  representation — a measurable independent spanning frame for `V` *given weak measurability of `V`*
  — is delivered `sorry`-free downstream in `Frontier.Issue6.CastaingSelection`
  (`Frontier.exists_measurable_independentSpanningFrame_of_measurableInfDist`), via a polarisation
  shortcut that bypasses dense measurable selection entirely: every projector coordinate is a fixed
  real combination of the scalar maps `x ↦ infDist c (V x)`, so weak measurability alone yields the
  measurable projected basis, from which the recursive measurable subframe picker
  (`Frontier.pickIndependent`) extracts the frame. Orthonormalisation is likewise `sorry`-free here
  (`isMeasurableOrthonormalFrame_gramSchmidtNormed`).

* **The wall is the KRN *hypothesis* in graph form = Arsenin–Kunugui.** What the bare graph does not
  give is *weak measurability* of `x ↦ V x`, i.e. measurability of
  `{x | infDist c (V x) < r} = {x | V x ∩ ball c r ≠ ∅}`. This set is
  `Prod.fst '' (graph ∩ (univ ×ˢ ball c r))`, the projection onto `X` of a Borel set whose
  `x`-sections `V x ∩ ball c r` are **σ-compact** (open subsets of the finite-dimensional, locally
  compact `V x`). *The projection of a Borel set with σ-compact sections is Borel* — this is the
  **Arsenin–Kunugui theorem** (Kechris, *Classical Descriptive Set Theory*, 18.18; Saint-Raymond).
  The statement here is therefore **true** (the σ-compact-section hypothesis is met), but Mathlib
  has only the Lusin–Souslin analytic-set machinery and the unrestricted projection of a Borel set
  is in general merely **analytic, not Borel** (Suslin), so the everywhere-Borel discharge requires
  the Arsenin–Kunugui strengthening, which is absent from Mathlib. (The a.e./universally-measurable
  weakening *is* available — projection ⟹ analytic ⟹ universally measurable — and is proved
  `sorry`-free in `Frontier.Issue6.MeasurableProjection` /
  `ErgodicTheory.Singular.MeasurableProjection`; that is the correct hypothesis for the a.e.
  multiplicative ergodic theorem and is already migrated into the linted library.)

This node is *equivalent to the converter's own target*:
`infDist c (V x) = ‖c − (V x).starProjection c‖`
(`Frontier.infDist_eq_norm_sub_starProjection`), so weak measurability of `V` is interderivable with
measurability of the projector. It is therefore a single irreducible measure-theoretic node, not a
removable detour, and the KRN/Castaing route cannot bypass it: KRN *consumes* weak measurability as
its hypothesis.

/-- **Existence of a measurable orthonormal frame from a measurable graph at constant rank.**
Combines the (blocked) independent-spanning-frame existence with `sorry`-free Gram–Schmidt
orthonormalisation (`isMeasurableOrthonormalFrame_gramSchmidtNormed`). The dependence on `sorry`
is inherited solely from `exists_measurable_independentSpanningFrame_of_measurableGraph`. -/

/-- **The target converter (constant rank).** A measurable graph together with constant finite
dimension `m` makes the orthogonal-projection matrix `x ↦ orthProjMatrix (V x)` measurable.
The proof extracts a measurable orthonormal frame from the graph
(`exists_measurable_orthonormalFrame_of_measurableGraph`) and feeds it to the `sorry`-free core
`measurable_orthProjMatrix_of_orthonormalFrame`. Consequently the inherited dependence on
`sorry` is confined to the one Castaing/KRN measurable-selection gap. -/

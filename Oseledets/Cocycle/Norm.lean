# Measurability of the L2 operator norm and the matrix inverse

The Oseledets / Furstenberg–Kesten development needs that the (scoped) L2 operator
norm `‖·‖` and the matrix inverse `M ↦ M⁻¹` are measurable as functions on
`Matrix (Fin d) (Fin d) ℝ` equipped with the entrywise (Pi) measurable structure
`Oseledets.instMeasurableSpaceMatrix`.

The subtlety (see the M5 blueprint, risk R1) is that Mathlib's `Measurable.norm` is
stated for a `BorelSpace`, whereas the matrix σ-algebra here is the Pi structure. The
L2 operator-norm topology on `Matrix (Fin d) (Fin d) ℝ` is *definitionally* the Pi
product topology (it is installed via `replaceTopology` along the entrywise-continuous
identification with continuous linear maps of `EuclideanSpace`), so the Pi measurable
structure is exactly the Borel structure of the norm topology. We record the
corresponding `OpensMeasurableSpace` instance and deduce measurability of `‖·‖` from
continuity; the matrix inverse is handled entrywise via the adjugate/determinant
formula.
